Main measures taken by the legislation to ensure that user data is protected are:<br><br>
1. The Data Protection Act of 1998:<br>
This act dictates terms on what companies can do with personal data. Any breach of rules could result in the company being prosecuted. This ensures that data cannot be shared without the person's consent. It also states that the user can access the data held by the organisation about them on request. It also allows the user to correct the data. Another restriction is that the data shouldn't be used for direct marketing.<br>
This is present in the UK.
<br><br>
2. Computer Misuse Act:
This act was introduced when two men were able to obtain unauthorised access to a British Telecom company's interactive viewdata service. Many criticize that it was framed in a hurry and that it's very shabby. However, it has inspired other countries to form other acts to ensure data protection. In 2004, it was amended to change the terms of punishment.
<br><br>
3. Information Technology Act (2000):

This is present in India. This law is very similar to the one mentioned above. The act mentions that any organisation holding personal information must implement appropriate security procedures. And any negligence on their part that leads to a wrongful loss or gain to a person will have to be compensated to the victim.
<br><br>
4. The Information Technology Rules (2011):
This states the procedures and security protocols that must be in place for any organisation that collects personal data.
<br><br>
Although it is not mentioned on their website, Amazon.in must be complying to these acts in order to be functional and legal. Other measures that are mentioned on their site include usage of Secure Socket Layer Level encryption whenever data is sent across or stored. 
<br><br>
They also mention that they only reveal the last 4 digits of your credit card number using transactions.

Other generic methods that can be used to prevent threats are:
<br><br>
1. Usage of anti-virus software
<br><br>
2. Strengthening your firewall
<br><br>
3. Limited access to sensitive data (using a username and a password)
<br><br>
However there is scope to misuse data as cyber criminals are constantly updating themselves to attack networks.
