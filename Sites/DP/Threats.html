Majority of the possibility of threats originate from three sources: Cookies, the user's firewall and the strength of the website's encryption standards.
<br><br>
Cookies are quite controversial as it is frequently debated whether they should be allowed to monitor your computer's activity. Although they are non-malicious, your privacy is invaded is cookies are used.
<br><br>
A very potential threat includes hacking. This can occur either because of the weakness of the user's firewall or the website's encryption.

Hackers are people who illegally steal data or damage systems for personal gain. The main threats from them include:
<br><br>
1. Data theft
<br>
<br>
This has been quite common recently. This is because many people are not aware of the dangers of data theft and thus do not take appropriate preventive measures. Such data theft could specifically be disastrous for important organizations such as banks, companies and mainly the government.
<br><br>
2. Creating a fake duplicate website to trick customers into paying for no goods on their website
<br>
<br>
This is a trick that is being used to attack unsuspecting customers. The website made is usually very well made and incredibly accurate. So unless the user is quite well versed with the internet, they could get tricked. Typically, these websites do not offer the goods but take the money from the customers.
<br><br>
3. Data interception or damage(loss)<br>
<br>
This is usually used only by highly skilled individuals and only for very important purposes. The communication in and out of the user's network is usually intercepted to take whatever data is needed by the hacker.
