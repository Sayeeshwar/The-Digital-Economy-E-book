eCommerce websites collect a lot of user information and use it for different purposes. Often the users don't even know about it. Although all this data is used to provide personnalised services, these companies need to do a good enough job protecting our data from hackers. This section covers how Amazon collects, uses and protects user data, which is mainly used for market research
<br><br>

To get to the root of the situation, we must see how these websites collect data from the user. These fall under three categories. The first one is the use of data surveys and questionnaires. This is often combined with some incentives to get as many users to use it as possible. Many websites use this technique to improve their user experience.
<br><br>
A more sly technique is the use of cookies on the website. As your web browser is mostly set to accept the use of cookies, you wouldn't even notice it most of the time, unless the site asks you for permission. These cookies form a local file on your computer that stores information on how you use their website such as which products you buy and your history. The website engine then analyzes these trends and provides a more personal webpage for you to use.
<br><br>
An even more invisible technique is the use of spyware. This is most definitely invisible to the user. It is legal because the data collected is only relevant to the use of their website. This is just the legal version of what hackers use to gain insight into your computer use.
