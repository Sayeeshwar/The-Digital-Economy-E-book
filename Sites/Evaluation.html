I am happy with the success of my database. I have used with databases before quite comfortably, but not with all the features. I used some of them like the 'Analyze table' for the first time. For the most part, I found everything easy to understand. 
<br>
<br>
<b>Making the database</b><br>

<br>

On working with the database, I managed to include as many validation rules that I could think of. This was important in making the database free of any errors in the future. I also tried making the entire database very user-friendly with the inclusion of features such as error messages and look-up tables so that the user can choose from a pre-defined list and thus not be confused about what to enter. Some fields also have an input mask that guides user as per the format of the data that they are about to enter.
<br>
<br>
I made the structure using the 'Analyze table' tool, which was very useful and easy. There were in built examples to make it easier for a first time user to use the database. The tables were automatically linked and indexed and this made it simple to relate each table to one another. To ensure the database worked perfectly, I analysed the structure and formed a good relational model. This ensures that the entire database records can be updated easily. Also, this enables the user to perform queries with data from multiple tables<br>
<br>
In the next stage, I created queries of various types that would generally be used to extract data from such large volumes of data. I thought of the most practical and useful filters that anybody would want to use. This led me to form 6 queries.

<br>
<br>
<b>Improvements and feedback from others</b><br>
<br>

Some improvements that could be made to the database are more detailed validation rules and input masks. Also, the fields could have descriptions as their comments, so that new users could familiarise themselves with the structure. And more queries could be made that cover more situations with more filters.
<br>
<br>
Regarding feedback from others, there have been a few mistakes that have been corrected and few design inputs. For example, my teacher said that I could use some parameter queries to ensure the user can filter the data he wants. Also, my friend asked me to sort the objects in the navigation pane according to the object type. This made it easier to find and open different objects. 
<br>
<br>
<b>Evaluation of my performance</b>
<br>
<br>
Overall, I think I performed quite well in this unit. I was able to learn and understand new concepts fairly quickly and I did the ePortfolio without much interference from anyone. Also, I was able to finish this unit on time. I also followed the standard ways of working as I classified my images and websites in separate folders under different headings
<br>
<br>
<b>Conclusion</b>
<br>
<br>
In the end, I would say that the database achieves its objectives successfully while being user-friendly and useful at the same time. The ePortfolio itself is colorful and easy to use, with good color schemes and clear structure.
