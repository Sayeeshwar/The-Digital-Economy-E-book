<section>
For an extensive process such as shopping online, there are quite a few transactions involved:
<br><br>
1.    Creating a new account: All users need to create an account to use Amazon's services. This is mainly used to identify your identity as well as track your shopping activities on their website
<br><br>
2.      Signing into your account: To just browse through the catalogue, you don't need to sign in to the website. However, when you purchase any item, you need to identify yourself to record who purchased what.
<br><br>
3.      Placing the order: After signing in and selecting your items, you checkout with the virtual basket by choosing the payment method and approving the order.
<br><br>
4.      Paying for the item: This is a follow up to the previous step. After placing the order, you need to provide your bank details to pay for your order. This involves giving your card details, which get checked with the bank database in order to be approved.
