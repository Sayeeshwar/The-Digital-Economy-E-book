Customer experience<br>
<br>

Overall, the website has a quite  easy to use feel to it. However for first time users and those who use it very frequently, there are a couple of things  that can be adjusted and thus improved. For example, the home page should not have so much content. This could be overwhelming for the user who would not know where to start. <br>
<br>
So the homepage could be simpler. Also the filtering systems could be more efficient in narrowing down the results in lesser number  of clicks. Additionally, the website looks quite bland  as it lacks a lot of color compared to other websites such as flipkart.com or myntra.com. Adding some color would improve the user experience drastically. <br>
<br>
The fonts are quite good as it is quite large enough and easy to read. However, the fonts are all quite the same and thus the page  looks quite monotonous. If different fonts are used throughout the page, it could be used to highlight different portions.
