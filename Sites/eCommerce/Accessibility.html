The website is mostly easy to use for anyone who is a regular computer user. However, for first timers, the website might be a little intimidating as there could be a lot of information. They would not know where to start looking and browsing for products. Sometimes, simplicity is key. However, once you use the site a couple of times,  you should be able to navigate easily.
 <br><br>
 This is because of the useful search bar and all the latest offers being displayed as banners.  Also, the interface is quite intuitive.

The only complicated portions of the website, if any are when you have to sign up for an amazon account or while you are checking out and paying for your purchase.
  <br><br>
For people with disabilities, amazon does not really offer much help. Only its kindle app for pc has a read aloud feature. The website as such might not offer much for disabled people, but there is software  that helps doing that in built into your PC or Mac. Maybe thatâ€™s why amazon does not offer services on its own.
 
It does have a mobile site for mobile users, although people using phones are most likely to be using the amazon app rather than the mobile website.
